The basic idea is to start the server inside an interactive PBS job and then connect to it tunneling through a login node. Below is step by step guide:
0) Download and install Paraview 5.8.0 on your local computer (versions on your local computer and gadi should match).
1) Start an interactive job:
{code:java}
qsub -I -X -lwalltime=3:00:00,mem=190GB,ncpus=48,jobfs=1GB
{code}
2) When the job starts, start pvserver:
{code:java}
module load paraview/5.8.0-mesa
mpirun pvserver &
{code}
The pvserver prints a connection message, for example:
Connection URL: cs://gadi-cpu-clx-1234:11111
Accepting connection(s): gadi-cpu-clx-1234:11111
3) Create an ssh tunnel through a gadi login node.
{code:java}
ssh -L11111:gadi-cpu-clx-1234:11111 your_user_name@gadi.nci.org.au
{code}
and login as usual
4) Run paraview locally

For instance, the output for project rr33 might indicate that data in /g/data/ww22 owned by user ab2345 is incorrectly owned by group rr33 instead of ww22. To rectify this, one should log in as user ab2345 and execute specific commands to transfer the project group ownership to ww22. This ensures that all data in /g/data/ww22 is always created under the ww22 project ownership.

There's limited space on the local hard disk and this needs to be shared between all the jobs running on the node.

For most jobs, a limit of 1GB for the standard output and error streams is more than sufficient. If a job uses more than this limit, it is likely to be unintentional. An easy way to fix this is by modifying your job script to redirect the output of your program to a file in your /scratch space, for instance.
Example:

# Redirect stdout and stderr to two separate files
